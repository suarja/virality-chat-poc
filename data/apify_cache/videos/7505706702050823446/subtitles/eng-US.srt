00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.659
everyone asks me how it is that my 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.179
chatGPT is also pissed

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:04.499
all you need is one order

00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:07.491
and I launch the agent professor synapse

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:09.622
so if you want it to be much more

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.342
intelligent and above all that he really listens to you

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:14.262
and that it is much easier to use

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:15.182
I will help you

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.662
and then you will go to the chatGPT settings

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:22.822
you will start by customizing chatGPT

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:25.022
so you activate if it's not already the case

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:27.063
you will fill in the information about yourself

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:29.183
which will allow him to have more than

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:30.783
context about you and your goals

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.743
so you will fill in these 2 parts

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:37.103
and especially we will concentrate on what is your style of chatGPT

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:37.935
and there

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:42.629
you will stick the prompt I will send you in your DMs if you comment

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:47.444
your synapse agent is installed

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.124
it will be enough for you

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.464
launch the /start command to start talking to him

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.545
there it will give you the other available orders

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.665
from then on he will ask you questions

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.491
to really know your goal

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.051
before going ball in the lead and answering the question

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.611
before having the necessary information

00:01:03.612 --> 00:01:06.314
it will allow us to short-circuit the bridle

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:10.041
prompt the basic instructions that OpenAI has

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:11.415
injected into chatGPT

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.695
because you guys are too expensive

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:17.095
that's â‚¬20 per month not enough for power users

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:20.535
users who really get the most out of chatGPT

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:23.015
who use it for their daily life

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:24.015
for their work

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:25.765
so there it will allow us to

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:30.762
bypass these basic instructions and force him to really

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:31.541
take the time

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:37.381
to understand our goal and respond in the best way possible
