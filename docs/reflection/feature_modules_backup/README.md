## 📚 **Key Concepts**

- **Code Consolidation**: Merging multiple modules into a single, maintainable system
- **Backup Strategy**: Preserving code for reference and potential reuse
- **Modular Architecture**: Organizing code into independent, reusable components
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating predictive features from raw data

## 🔧 **Integration Guidelines**

### **If You Want to Use These Modules**

**1. Assessment Phase**

```python
# Check if functionality is already in modular system
from src.features.modular_feature_system import FeatureRegistry
registry = FeatureRegistry()
available_features = registry.list_feature_sets()
```

**2. Integration Phase**

```python
# Create new feature set based on backup module
from src.features.modular_feature_system import BaseFeatureSet

class AdvancedFeatureSet(BaseFeatureSet):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("advanced", "Advanced features from backup")
        # Implement features from backup module
```

**3. Testing Phase**

```python
# Test integration thoroughly
def test_advanced_features():
    extractor = create_feature_extractor(['advanced'])
    features = extractor.extract_features(video_data, gemini_analysis)
    assert 'advanced_feature' in features
```

### **Best Practices**

- **Start Small**: Integrate one feature at a time
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- **Document Changes**: Update documentation for new features
- **Performance Test**: Measure impact on pipeline performance
